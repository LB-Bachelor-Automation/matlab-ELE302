# Matlab scripts to use and examples to use

This is some Matlab code. Feel free to use it as you wish.

----------------------------------------------------------

The "function" folder contains functions.  
Copy it to your workspace.

If you want to keep the folder intact use the command:

```matlab

addpath(".\functions\")

```

This adds the relative path of the entire content of the folder to your workspace.
